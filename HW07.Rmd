## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(classdata)
data("happy", package = "classdata")
head(happy)
```
```{r}
#part one (cleaning data)
HAPPY <- replace(happy, happy == "IAP", NA)
HAPPY <- replace(happy, happy == "DK", NA)
HAPPY <- replace(happy, happy == "NA", NA)
str(happy)
happy %>% summarise(average.age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))
group_by(happy,marital) %>% summarise(average.age.m = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% mutate(rank.by.age = rank(average.age.m))
#part2
ggplot(data = happy, aes(x = , y = ))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
